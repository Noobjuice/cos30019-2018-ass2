	Features:
		1) User shall be able to test if q is entailed from KB.
		2) User can access the program with the help of a bash file.
		3) Forward Chaining method helps the user to find the query from the given facts.
		4) Backward Chaining can be used to prove query by backtracking through given clauses to reach the fact.

Acknowledgement/Resources:
	1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZJs6w2YFRM
		-This link was used to understand what is the basic difference between forward and backward chaining.
		-It r-iterated through points which should be kept in mind when designing code of the methods like
			- Making sure to avoid duplicates in backward chaining.
			- Avoid infinite loops.
	2) AI Textbook 3rd edition page 258
		- Textbook was referred for the pseudocode of forward chaining and to understand how the program should flow and
		  what things to avoid.
	3) http://snipplr.com/view/56297/
		- As there was not much information available about pseudocode for backward chaining, this link was used to understand
		  how the program flows for backward chaining and what things are to be kept in mind for it to work properly.

Notes:

Summary Report:
	The team comprised of two members James and Manan who divided the responsibility among themselves.
		- James
			- Created basic skeleton of the program.
			- Added code for reading content from the file.
			- Worked on the read me file and gave input.
			- Implemented the whole truth table method.
		- Manan	
			- Modified some code in the basic skeleton of how the output is returned to the main class and shown on console.
			- Implemented the whole Forward Chaining.
			- Implemented the whole Backward Chaining.
			- Created half of the readme file.

	Both members regulary met in person to discuss the update made by each and to understand if someone is going the wrong way.
	To communicated out of regular hours, facebook was used to update and ask for help if stuck on any part of the program where both
	readily helped each other throughout the implication of the assignment.
